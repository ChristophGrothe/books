  <p class="p-question"><tt>So what are we doing here and why? Well, that's a good question, to be honest, but we hear that question quite often. So we wanna try to answer it.</tt></p>
  <p class="p-coffee"><tt>Sebastian has this lovely bookstore-coffee in the old city of Oxford. And after work (after hopefully having shot a lot of amazing photos), we often spend the evening there.</tt></p>

  <p class="p-activities"><tt>Spending the evening their together, we enjoy reading a good book, talking about politics, discussing about philosophy, as well as getting to know interesting young students who like to share the log fire with us.</tt></p>
  <p class="p-Maria"><tt>And one evening we got to know Maria, who meanwhile has become a good friend of us. She studies arts as well as physics and when we told her about our both jobs, she asked us, if we ever had the idea already, to combine our both passions into one project: A gallery out of photos from books!</tt></p>
